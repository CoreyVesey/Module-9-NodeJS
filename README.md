 # README Generator
          
  ![Github license]()

  ## Description
  The README generator was built to save time and create a consistent document to include in all future projects. It allows for all the reused information and formatting to be included in all projects without having to re-enter everything. Through this project I learned more about using Node.JS and Inquirer and how it can be used to ask a series of questions to then be filled into the assigned spots within the template I created.
